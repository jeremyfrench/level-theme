<h2 class="section-title">FAQs.</h2>

  <h2>Who is Level Business?</h2>
<p>We are an early stage company, with experience in business 
information, technology and user experience design. We are funded and 
supported by great venture capitalists (<a href="http://www.indexventures.com/">Index Ventures</a> and <a href="http://www.edenventures.co.uk/">Eden Ventures</a>).
  We are a private limited company (Level Business Ltd), registered in 
England and Wales (No. 06937730) and registered for VAT (No. 105393531).
 We are registered with the Information Commissioner's Office (No. 
Z2500904). Our basement office is in Clerkenwell in London at 4 Pear 
Tree Court, London, EC1R 0DS.</p>
<h2>Why is Level Business providing this information for free?  Will I have to pay for it sometime in the future?</h2>
<p>We believe in removing barriers to any business data that is valuable
 to users who need to know more about UK businesses in their daily work.
  We don't believe in charging for access to data and want to provide as
 much value as possible to users of this site without any fee, so that 
everyone can benefit.  In time, we intend to build paid-for services on 
top of the data - but will always make the data itself freely available.</p>
<p>The business world is currently divided into the data rich and data 
poor.  Data is sold by volume and most of it is out of the reach of 
smaller businesses.  That is why we called our company 'level'.  We want
 to create information equality so that everyone benefits.  The unequal 
access to accurate, timely information wastes effort, drives poor 
decision making and creates friction across the UK economy.</p>
<h2>What are Level Business's long term intentions?</h2>
<p>We are building an increasingly valuable body of business 
information, from multiple sources, and we are making it as accessible 
and as useful as we possibly can.  In time, we intend to provide 
multiple services, for different types of users, based on that 
information.</p>
<h2>Why are my company accounts being made available to everyone?</h2>
<p>The financial accounts we are publishing are already publicly 
available through Companies House. Level Business is simply making them 
more accessible to everyone, under a licence from Companies House, by 
removing the barriers to their use. Currently they are hidden behind a 
pay wall; users have to pay a fee and can wait up to 30 minutes for the 
download. Through levelbusiness.com they are searchable, immediately 
viewable and free. Not only will this save countless hours for the 
current users of the service, but it will encourage greater use of this 
important data.</p>
<h2>Can I take my company data down if I want to?</h2>
<p>Sorry, but no. That isn't possible. Businesses can not remove their financial data from public view at Companies House.</p>
<h2>My company data is incorrect.  What can I do?</h2>
<p>We believe the company accounts shown on the site are accurate as 
they are a direct representation of what is already available at 
Companies House. However there is a Feedback button on every page and we
 encourage you to use this to report anything that you believe is 
incorrect. </p>
<h2>Are there any legal restrictions on what I can do with the data Level Business is providing?</h2>
