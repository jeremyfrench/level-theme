      <p>The idea for this business grew from the frustrations of my wife, who
 runs her own design business. One day she asked "Why can’t  I put 'roof
 slate suppliers' into Google and get a list back based on how reliable 
they are?" The idea of providing businesses with information <em>about</em> each other, to make it easier to do business <em>with</em> each other was born.</p>
      <p>There is so much information about businesses on the internet, but 
it's not organised and presented in a way to answer my wife’s question. 
Organise and present that information to help businesses trade 
better...now that is a bold vision.</p>
<p>With a great team and great backing we are building the best web 
application we can to deliver to businesses information they can use, 
free and without barriers, so that they can trade better, faster and 
more cheaply.</p>

      <p>Mark likes to bring seemingly disconnected worlds together. As an invited expert at the W3C he invented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a> to bring HTML and the semantic web together, he wrote the JavaScript library <a href="http://backplanejs.googlecode.com/">backplanejs</a>,
 to merge XForms with JS, and now he wants to take the best from the 
semantic web and Hadoop and make them play nicely together.</p>
