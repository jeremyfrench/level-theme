<p class="page_intro">All private limited and public companies must supply a signed set of annual accounts to Companies House every year.</p>
  
<p>Depending on the size of a business, there are three different 
obligations for filing: small, medium or large. What determines these 
are a combination of turnover, balance sheet total and number of 
employees.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Terminology.</h2>

<p><a href="#balancesheet" class="section_link">The Balance Sheet</a></p>
<p>The Balance Sheet shows the financial position of a business at the 
year end. It shows two important things, where the funds have come from 
(the Liabilities) and how the money has been spent (the assets). It 
represents one point in time and it can be referred to as the "snap 
shot".</p>
<p><a href="#profitandloss" class="section_link">Profit and Loss Account</a></p>
<p>The Profit and Loss Account shows the Net Profit or Loss the business
 has made within an accounting period. It shows the total revenues the 
company has made and the total expenses incurred to generate that 
revenue. Unlike the balance sheet, it shows all the revenue and expenses
 over the accounting period and is not a "snap shot". A Net Profit is 
made if total expenditure is less than total revenues.</p>
