<p class="intro">All private limited and public companies must supply a signed set of annual accounts to Companies House every year.</p>
  
<p>Depending on the size of a business, there are three different obligations for filing: small, medium or large. What determines these are a combination of turnover, balance sheet total and number of employees.</p>

<h2>The Balance Sheet</h2>

<p>The Balance Sheet shows the financial position of a business at the year end. It shows two important things, where the funds have come from (the Liabilities) and how the money has been spent (the assets). It represents one point in time and it can be referred to as the “snap shot”.</p>

<h2>Profit and Loss Account</h2>

<p>The Profit and Loss Account shows the Net Profit or Loss the business has made within an accounting period. It shows the total revenues the company has made and the total expenses incurred to generate that revenue. Unlike the balance sheet, it shows all the revenue and expenses over the accounting period and is not a “snap shot”. A Net Profit is made if total expenditure is less than total revenues.</p>
